1 - Randomize the below variable such as class randvar; rand bit [7:0] var1, var2, var3, var4; endclass
2 - There are two constraints applied to same variable ‘A’. one will generate the value within the range of [25:50] and another expression says the variable value should be greater than 40. What should be the value generated, and what is the reason?
3 - Write a single constraint to generate random values for bit [8:0] variable in the below range, 1-34, 127, 129-156, 192-202,257-260.
4 - Write a constraint without an inside function to generate random values within the range of 34 to 43?
5 - Write a constraint to generate a random value for a var1 [7:0] within 50 and var2 [7:0] with the non-repeated value in every randomization?
6 - Without using randomization method or rand keyword(modifiers), generate an array of unique values.
7 - Generate unique elements in an array without using the keyword unique.
8 - Write a constraint to generate 0, 1, x and z randomly.
